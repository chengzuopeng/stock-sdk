## 📦 Get Stock Quotes in 10 Lines

```typescript
import { StockSDK } from 'stock-sdk';

const sdk = new StockSDK();

// Get A-Share real-time quotes
const quotes = await sdk.getSimpleQuotes(['sh000001', 'sz000858', 'sh600519']);

quotes.forEach(q => {
  console.log(`${q.name}: ${q.price} (${q.changePercent}%)`);
});
```

## 🌟 Why Stock SDK?

If you're a frontend engineer, you may have encountered these problems:

- Most stock tools are **Python ecosystem**, hard to use directly in frontend
- Want to build a quote dashboard / demo without maintaining a backend
- Financial APIs return messy formats, complex encoding (GBK / concurrency / batch)
- AkShare is powerful, but not suitable for browser or Node.js projects

**Stock SDK's goal is simple:**

> Let frontend engineers elegantly get stock quote data using familiar JavaScript / TypeScript.

## 🤖 AI Tool Integration

One command to give your AI assistant real-time stock data capabilities:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stock-sdk": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "stock-sdk-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After configuration, ask directly in Cursor / Claude:

- "Analyze Tencent's recent MACD trend"
- "Find the top 10 STAR Market stocks by gain today"
- "Check my portfolio P&L"
